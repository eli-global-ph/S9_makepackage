# S9_makepackage
This is tool to create fw package for S9/T9/R4 and other miner with 1387chip
before use this tool, must set an environment :
/home/rex/s9_makepackage

for example:
XILINX_PACKAGE_BASE_PATH=/home/XILINX/UBI/make-packages
export XILINX_PACKAGE_BASE_PATH

This project need mtd utility, which support JFFS2 and UBI.

To create S9 package:
./makepackage 550 S9 user all merge
The command line's output will show the position of fw package created.

1. 550: is the default freq value, But it is not used in auto freq mode miner.
2. S9: is the miner type, support: S9   T9    R4   T9+
3. user: is the package open to consumers.  (only can set "user" for fw package.)
4. all: is the control board type. all means support xilinx board and altera board.
5. merge: is used to combine the file system for upgrading usage with the normal miner's fw file system together, to fix some miner's failure on upgrade.


There are only two application from bitmain: single-board-test and bmminer, which must be copied to app-bin subdir before make package.
